Important Note: only jobs that borrow can be preempted (see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues/2681). 

* Apply all preemption files
* Configure two distributed workloads notebooks
* Deploy team-b cluster with `head-cpu=2` and `min_cpu=1, num_workers=2` and add `labels={"kueue.x-k8s.io/priority-class":"dev-priority"}` to Ray cluster configuration
* `watch oc get raycluster -A`
* Deploy team-a cluster with `head-cpu=2` and `min_cpu=1, num_workers=2` and add `labels={"kueue.x-k8s.io/priority-class":"prod-priority"}` to Ray cluster configuration
* observe preemption

How to debug: use `oc get workloads` and look at the kueue status
